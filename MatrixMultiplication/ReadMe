This is a python file that takes matrices from the user and multiplies them. This is intended to be modified for use in other programs and can be edited slightly to automatically input matrices form a data set
The program can be changed to be more efficient using numpy but I chose to program the calculation for the multiplication without imports for a challenge, meaning the program can be modified to work more efficiently
by replacing lines 40-44 with finalM = numpy.matmul[m1][m2] and importing numpy
